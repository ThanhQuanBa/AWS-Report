### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is clean, organized, and comfortable, helping me stay focused and productive. I also appreciate the culture of open communication, where team members give constructive feedback and support each other. However, I think it would be great to have more team-bonding or social activities to strengthen connections among everyone.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor provides clear, detailed guidance and patiently explains concepts when I don’t understand something. I truly feel the mentor is dedicated and supportive, especially when I’m dealing with new or difficult topics. The admin team also assists with administrative tasks, shares necessary documents, and quickly resolves any issues that arise. I especially appreciate that my mentor encourages me to find solutions on my own instead of simply giving the answer, which helps me learn more effectively.

**3. Relevance to Academic Major**  
The tasks assigned to me are well aligned with what I studied at university, while also exposing me to new areas I had never worked with before. This allows me to both reinforce my foundational knowledge and gain real-world practical skills. Some tasks in the project also helped me understand how AWS technologies are applied in real business use cases.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many valuable skills such as using project management tools, task planning, teamwork, and professional communication. My mentor also shared practical industry insights that helped me shape my career direction and improve my problem-solving mindset. Additionally, I had opportunities to explore new technologies, which broadened my perspective and increased my confidence when handling technical tasks.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone is respectful, collaborative, and committed to their work while still maintaining an enjoyable atmosphere. I especially appreciate the strong team spirit—whenever urgent tasks arise, everyone works together and supports each other regardless of their role. This made me feel truly included as part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when necessary, which helps me balance school and work. I also appreciate the opportunity to join internal training sessions, which gave me access to more knowledge and practical experience. Overall, I feel well-supported throughout the entire internship journey.
