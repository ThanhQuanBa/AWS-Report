# Event Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2: DevOps on AWS”

## Date & Topic

- **Date:** Monday, November 17, 2025 (1:00 PM – 4:30 PM)
- **Topic:** DevOps on AWS

## Event Purpose

- Provide a deep understanding of **DevOps principles, processes, and best practices** on AWS.
- Introduce and guide usage of **AWS Developer Tools** (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline) to build automated **CI/CD pipelines**.
- Focus on advanced deployment strategies such as **Blue/Green Deployment** and **Canary Release** to minimize risks.
- Explore integration of **Security (DevSecOps)** and **Monitoring** into the DevOps lifecycle.

## Speakers

- Detailed speaker information is not available; assumed to be AWS Vietnam **Solution Architects**.

## Key Highlights

### 1. DevOps Principles and AWS Developer Tools

- **DevOps Culture & Principles:** Emphasis on automation, observability, and continuous improvement.
- **Building CI/CD Pipelines:** Guidance on using AWS CodePipeline to automate the flow from code commit to production.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Introduction to AWS CloudFormation and AWS CDK for managing infrastructure as code.

### 2. Advanced Deployment Strategies

- **Zero-Downtime Deployment:** Analysis of advanced deployment techniques:
  - **Blue/Green Deployment:** Deploy new version alongside old, then switch traffic.
  - **Canary Release:** Deploy new version to a small subset of users before full rollout.
- **AWS Services in Action:** Using Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Lambda to support these strategies.

### 3. Monitoring, Logging, and DevSecOps

- **Observability:** Use Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray to collect metrics, logs, and traces for faster issue detection and resolution.
- **DevSecOps:** Integrate security tools (e.g., Amazon Inspector, Amazon GuardDuty) into Build and Deploy stages to detect vulnerabilities early.

## Key Learnings

### Core DevOps Skills

- **Professional CI/CD Design:** Learn how to design a resilient, robust CI/CD pipeline using AWS tools.
- **Deployment Risk Mitigation:** Understand pros and cons of Blue/Green and Canary strategies, and when to apply them for **Zero Downtime**.

### Security and Observability

- **DevSecOps Mindset:** Recognize the importance of "Shift Left" – embedding security early in the development lifecycle.
- **Observability:** Understand the difference between Monitoring and Observability, and how to use **Logs, Metrics, Traces** for a comprehensive system view.

## Workplace Applications

- **Automated Deployment:** Implement **CodePipelines** for new projects to automate Build, Test, and Deploy processes.
- **Improved Go-Live Strategy:** Apply **Canary Release** for critical features to ensure stability and collect early user feedback.
- **Enhanced Observability:** Integrate X-Ray for end-to-end request tracing, improving debugging in distributed microservices.

## Event Experience

This was a hands-on session emphasizing practical application of AWS DevOps principles.

- **Practical Value:** In-depth exploration of advanced deployment strategies provided immediately applicable knowledge for production environments.
- **Tool Ecosystem:** Gained a better understanding of how AWS tools (Code\* services, CloudWatch, X-Ray) work together to create a complete DevOps workflow.
