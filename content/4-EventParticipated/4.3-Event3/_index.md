# Event Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS”

## Date & Topic

- **Date:** Saturday, November 15, 2025 (8:30 AM – 12:00 PM)
- **Topic:** AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

## Event Purpose

- Provide an overview of AWS **AI/ML** services.
- Introduce **Amazon SageMaker**, the end-to-end ML platform.
- Dive into **Generative AI (GenAI)** and **Foundation Models** using **Amazon Bedrock**.
- Guide on **Prompt Engineering** techniques and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture.

## Speakers

- Detailed information about speakers is not available; assumed to be AWS Vietnam **Solution Architects**.

## Key Highlights

### 1. AWS AI/ML Services Overview

- **Amazon SageMaker:** Complete machine learning (ML) lifecycle, including data preparation, training, tuning, model deployment, and integrated **MLOps**.
- **Live Demo:** Hands-on with **SageMaker Studio**.

### 2. Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

- **Foundation Models:** Compare and select models such as **Claude, Llama, Titan**.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Advanced techniques like **Chain-of-Thought reasoning** and **Few-shot learning**.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Architecture and integration with a **Knowledge Base** to enhance accuracy and context in GenAI applications.
- **Bedrock Agents & Guardrails:** Build multi-step workflows and implement **Guardrails** to ensure safe AI usage.

## Key Learnings

### GenAI & ML Skills

- **End-to-End ML Deployment:** Master the essential steps to build and deploy ML models on **SageMaker** efficiently.
- **Bedrock Proficiency:** Understand Bedrock components and capabilities of different Foundation Models.
- **RAG Techniques:** Learn RAG architecture as a key enabler to integrate GenAI into real-world enterprise applications with private data.

## Workplace Applications

- **Build GenAI Proof-of-Concept (PoC):** Use **Amazon Bedrock** to quickly prototype GenAI use cases (e.g., document summarization, knowledge-based chatbots) with RAG techniques.
- **Prompt Optimization:** Apply **Prompt Engineering** techniques to improve responses from large language models.

## Event Experience

- **Hands-on Practice:** Live demos on SageMaker and Bedrock provided practical insights on service deployment.
- **Technical Depth:** The event focused on technical details like model selection and prompt optimization, giving a stronger foundation than introductory events.
